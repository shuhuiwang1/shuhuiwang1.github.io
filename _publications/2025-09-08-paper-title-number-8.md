title: "Cell Fate Prediction Using Dose-Response Autoencoder Model"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'In silico, drug screening is limited by our incomplete understanding of how cells respond to chemical perturbations. Recently, the effects of these perturbations on gene interaction networks have become accessible through RNA sequencing, which generates vast amounts of data. This information holds the potential to predict drug responses; however, analyzing such data remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise. While these data provide the link to expression perturbations, data bridging these perturbations to phenotype responses are scarce. Therefore, the need is twofold: (i) predicting the dose-dependent gene expression response and (ii) predicting the phenotypic response triggered by the genetic perturbation. To address the first point, we developed DORA (DOse-Response Autoencoder), designed to capture the dose-dependent effects on gene expression. DORA models the gradual drug perturbation as a trajectory in a low-dimensional latent space, constructed iteratively. As for the second point, we first cross-referenced the gene expression data with the drug inhibition from DrugComb. Then, we developed a classifier to link the latent representation from DORA to cellular viability, bridging molecular changes with phenotypic outcomes. We validate DORA on a bulk and a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. DORA achieves comparable performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, with an R2 of 0.92 in a general scenario and R2 = 0.81 in the prediction of unseen compounds. Besides, it attains a high accuracy on the prediction of the cell states, especially alive or inhibited. Furthermore, it identifies the important genes related to cancer cell inhibition, which act as tumor suppressors. This highlights the potential of our approach not only for drug screening but also for identifying novel targets, ultimately advancing personalized oncology.'
