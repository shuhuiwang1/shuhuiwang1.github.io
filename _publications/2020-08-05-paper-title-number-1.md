excerpt: 'This paper developed a fractional order SEIHDR model to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The main contribution: 1) the proposed model displayed a good agreement with the data of Japan and the USA. 2) we theoretically demonstrated that the model can reach a basic reproduction number smaller than 1, which means that it is possible to control COVID-19.'
